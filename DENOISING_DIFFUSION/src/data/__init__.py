Data loading and preprocessing utilities for astronomical observations.

This module provides classes and functions for:
- Loading FITS files from ALMA/VLT observations
- Loading synthetic training data from simulations
- Data augmentation techniques (physics-aware)
- Train/val/test splitting utilities
- PyTorch Dataset and DataLoader creation

The legacy exports below are resolved lazily (PEP 562). They belong to the
continuum/patch era the 2026-06-18 pivot deprecated, and importing them eagerly
made every line-emission import pull in `torchvision` and the `X | Y` type syntax
of Python 3.10+ -- neither of which the line-emission pipeline uses. That coupling
broke `import src.data.fits_cube_dataset` on interpreters older than 3.10 even
though the module itself is compatible, which blocked running the test suite
locally before pushing to Kaggle. Resolving on first attribute access keeps
`from src.data import AstroDataset` working and leaves the line-emission path
dependency-free.
