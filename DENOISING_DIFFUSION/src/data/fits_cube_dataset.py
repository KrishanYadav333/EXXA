=============================
PyTorch Dataset for line-emission FITS cubes — full-image, channel-by-channel.

Design (per 2026-06-18 mentor pivot):
  - Full-image input (no patches); downsample to `target_size` (default 256) for memory.
  - Train on individual velocity channels, sampled per cube via the Gaussian sampler
    (`channel_sampler.sample_channel_indices`): ~center 100, ~75% in [50,150], extremes avoided.
  - Each (cube, channel) pair is one dataset item, so __len__ = n_cubes * channels_per_cube.
  - __getitem__ reads ONLY the requested channel slice via astropy memmap (the full
    201x600x600 cube is never materialised).
  - Per-CHANNEL min-max normalization to [0,1] (channels have very different intensity
    ranges; the dirty cubes also contain negative noise so per-channel min-max is needed).

Returns (dirty_channel, clean_channel), each shape (1, target_size, target_size), float32 in [0,1].
