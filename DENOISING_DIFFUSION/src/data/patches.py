src/data/patches.py
===================
Patch-based training and overlap-blended tiled inference for line-emission cubes.

Two problems, one idea.

**Training.** The line-emission set is 14 cubes from 11 simulations, and only 6 RunIDs are
trained on. A DDPM learns a distribution, which needs far more independent samples than a
regressor needs to learn a conditional mean -- that gap is the leading explanation for the
DDPM trailing the U-Net by ~19 dB here. Cutting each 256x256 channel into patches does not
create new disks, but it does turn one whole-image sample into many distinct local
structures (ring edge, inner cavity, background, line core), which is what a denoiser
actually has to model. Denoising is local: cleaning a pixel needs its neighbourhood, not
the far side of the disk.

**Inference.** Evaluation currently downsamples 600 -> 256, denoises, then upsamples back,
so every reported number is limited by that round trip. `tiled_denoise` runs the model at
its native tile size across the full 600x600 field instead, with no resampling at all.

Naive tiling leaves visible seams -- each tile is denoised in ignorance of its neighbours
and the discontinuity lands mid-image, exactly where moment maps are computed. Tiles are
therefore overlapped and blended with a separable Hann window, so contributions cross-fade
and sum to one everywhere.

        patch_size: side of each square patch.
        n_patches: patches drawn per item.

            channel rather than placed uniformly. Purely uniform placement wastes most
            patches on empty sky, because the disk covers a small part of the field.
