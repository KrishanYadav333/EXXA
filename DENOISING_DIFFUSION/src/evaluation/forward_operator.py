"""
Phase 0 of PHYSICS_INFORMED_PLAN.md: what actually produced the dirty cubes?

DDRM constrains the reverse diffusion chain with a known forward operator `A` such that
`dirty = A(clean) + noise`. The method is only worth building if `A` is a non-trivial
operator we can write down. Two possibilities with opposite conclusions:

  1. dirty = clean (*) beam + noise   -> a real convolution, DDRM applies, build it.
  2. dirty = clean + noise            -> A = I, DDRM degenerates to the conditional DDPM
                                         that already exists, and there is nothing to gain.

BMAJ/BMIN/BPA sitting in the headers and the MCFOST provenance both point at (1), but that
is an inference and this module is the check.

The discriminator is the azimuthally averaged power spectrum. Write P_d and P_c for the
dirty and clean spectra and |B(k)| for the beam's transfer function:

    convolution:  P_d(k) = |B(k)|^2 P_c(k) + N     -> the ratio DIPS below 1 at mid-k,
                                                      because |B(k)| < 1 there
    additive:     P_d(k) =            P_c(k) + N   -> the ratio only ever RISES above 1

A convolution suppresses intermediate spatial frequencies. Additive noise cannot suppress
anything; it only adds power. That asymmetry is what makes the two easy to tell apart, and
it survives not knowing the noise level, because the noise term is estimated and removed
before the ratio is formed.

There is a third answer the plan cares about. If a convolution is present but its transfer
function is not Gaussian, a true interferometric dirty beam was used, sidelobes and all, and
a Gaussian `A` would make DDRM enforce the wrong constraint. That case needs the PSF image
from whoever generated the cubes, so it is reported separately rather than folded into (1).

    Fit the forward model directly instead of thresholding a ratio:

    `noise_basis` defaults to 1 (white noise). For a Jy/beam map it should be |B_header(k)|^2:
    the noise in such a map has been through the same beam as the signal, so its power
    spectrum is beam-shaped rather than flat. On this project's cubes a flat basis cannot fit
    -- the implied N runs from 16 down to 2e-9 across the band -- while a beam-shaped one
    holds it within about 1.5 orders.

    Three unknowns. `A` absorbs any intensity-scale factor between the two maps (Jy/beam
    against Jy/pixel is a factor of the beam area, order 200 here), `N` is the noise floor,
    and `sigma` is the beam. Fitting them together is what makes the answer scale-invariant
    by construction rather than by a normalisation that has to be chosen correctly.

    Two earlier versions of this check failed on exactly that choice. Testing whether the raw
    ratio dips below 1 fails when A != 1. Normalising the ratio by its own low-k level then
    taking the minimum over the whole band fails the other way, because for a monotonically
    RISING ratio the lowest bin is by construction below the median of the lowest bins, so a
    dip appears where nothing was suppressed. Both produced confident, wrong verdicts on the
    project's real cubes.

    Given sigma the model is linear in (A, N), so a 1D scan over sigma with a linear solve at
    each step is exact and needs no optimiser. Residuals are relative, because P_clean spans
    several orders of magnitude and an unweighted fit would see only the lowest frequencies.
