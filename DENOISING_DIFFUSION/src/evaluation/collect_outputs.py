=================================
Bundle one notebook's artifacts into a versioned, self-describing folder.

Results used to land in a single flat `results/` directory with no record of which
notebook produced them or which revision of the code was running -- so
`moment_map_holdout_summary_ddpm.csv` from a run with the unmasked M2 metric was
indistinguishable from one written after the noise-clip fix, and the only way to tell
was to remember. Each run now writes

    <root>/<notebook_id>/<UTC timestamp>_<git sha>/

with a manifest recording the commit, the time, and a checksum per file. Nothing
overwrites anything, so two runs can be compared directly instead of by recollection.

            in the 5000-file git clone) and ../results locally.
