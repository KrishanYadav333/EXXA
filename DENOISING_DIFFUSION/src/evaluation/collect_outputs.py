=================================
Bundle one notebook's artifacts into a versioned, self-describing folder.

Results used to land in a single flat `results/` directory with no record of which
notebook produced them or which revision of the code was running -- so
`moment_map_holdout_summary_ddpm.csv` from a run with the unmasked M2 metric was
indistinguishable from one written after the noise-clip fix, and the only way to tell
was to remember. Each run now writes

    <root>/<notebook_id>/<UTC timestamp>_<git sha>/

with a manifest recording the commit, the time, and a checksum per file. Nothing
overwrites anything, so two runs can be compared directly instead of by recollection.

    Copy this notebook's artifacts into a versioned run folder and write a manifest.

    Args:
        notebook_id: folder name for this notebook, e.g. '09-architecture-comparison'.
        patterns: glob patterns (basenames are fine) naming what this notebook produces.
            Patterns matching nothing are recorded in the manifest as `missing` rather
            than passed over silently -- a result that did not get written is exactly
            what you want to notice here.
        root: destination root. Defaults to /kaggle/working/outputs on Kaggle (top level,
            so the bundle is unambiguously part of the notebook Output and is not buried
            in the 5000-file git clone) and ../results locally.
        roots: directories to search for the artifacts.
        extra: anything else worth recording -- key config, headline metrics.
        version: Kaggle version number, if known. Prefixes the run folder with 'v<N>_'.
            Left None it is probed from the environment and usually stays None; see
            results/RUNS.md, which maps run folders to versions from the push commits.
        stamp / sha: override the run tag. Only for filing results produced BEFORE this
            collector existed, where "now" and "current HEAD" would both be wrong; a live
            run must leave these unset so the tag reflects what actually ran.
        move: git mv the files instead of copying, so history follows them. Used when
            reorganising an existing flat results/ directory, not by a live run.
