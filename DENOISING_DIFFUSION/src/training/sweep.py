src/training/sweep.py
=====================
Training with early stopping + random hyperparameter sweep, across architectures
(mentor direction, 2026-07-20 meeting):

  * random search first -- explore the space, gather statistics (a Bayesian
    sweep seeded with these runs can follow later; starting Bayesian risks
    honing in on the wrong region).
  * swept: base width, channel multipliers, learning rate, LR-scheduler
    patience, HybridLoss alpha (beta = 1 - alpha), beam conditioning on/off.
  * every run is scored on FIXED metrics (PSNR / SSIM / MSE on val) -- never
    on the swept loss, whose weights differ between runs.
  * early stopping: min/max epochs with patience on the fixed val PSNR.

`train_unet` is also used standalone for the single beam-conditioned run.

    Early stopping (mentor, 2026-07-20): train at least `min_epochs`, at most

            across architectures, which is what makes the scores comparable.

        latent_dim: VAE only -- channels in the latent map.
        kl_weight: VAE only -- weight on the KL term. Ignored by architectures
            with no extra loss, so a single sweep driver can pass it blindly.

    Note the name kept for backwards compatibility: `train_unet` now trains any

    """
    Train the SAME configuration under several seeds and report mean +/- std.

    Why this exists
    ---------------
    V7 and V9 were the identical configuration trained twice, and the Moment-2
    improvement moved from +18.4% to +2.5% on the same test cube -- pure run-to-run
    variance. That finding is what forced multi-cube evaluation, but every headline
    number since has still come from a SINGLE training run, so a claim like
    "37.11 dB beats V12's 32.95 dB" has no error bar on either side and could be
    seed noise. This runs a config `n_seeds` times so the comparison has one.

    What is varied, and what is not
    -------------------------------
    Only `train_unet`'s seed changes -- weight init, data order, and any
    augmentation stream. The cube split is seeded separately (`split_cubes`) and
    is deliberately held FIXED: re-splitting per seed would mix split variance
    into the estimate and stop the runs being comparable to V12, which used one
    fixed split. So the spread reported here is training variance on a fixed split,
    which is exactly the quantity the V7/V9 lesson is about.

    Args:
        n_seeds: number of repeats. 3 is the practical floor for a std to mean
            anything; the std is reported with ddof=1 and is itself noisy at n=3.
        base_seed: seeds used are base_seed, base_seed+1, ...
        out_csv: append one row per seed (crash-safe, same pattern as `run_sweep`).
        ckpt_dir: if given, each seed's best checkpoint is saved as
            `{ckpt_dir}/{tag}_seed{N}.pth`, so the moment-map protocol can be run
            per seed instead of only on the last model.
        tag: label used in the CSV and checkpoint filenames.
        resume: skip any (tag, seed) already recorded in `out_csv` and reuse its
            metrics. A 12-run repeat is several GPU-hours and Kaggle sessions time
            out mid-way; without this, resuming means retraining arms that already
            finished. Set False to force a clean re-run.
        **config: forwarded to `train_unet` (base_channels, lr, alpha, use_beam, ...).

    Returns:
        {"tag", "n_seeds", "rows": [per-seed dicts], "psnr": {"mean","std","values"},
         "ssim": {...}, "mse": {...}, "best_val_loss": {...}}

    Note that the model objects are dropped from the returned rows -- keeping
    `n_seeds` models alive is what makes a repeat loop run the GPU out of memory.
