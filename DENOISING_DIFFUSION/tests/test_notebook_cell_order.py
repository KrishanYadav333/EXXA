"""
Check that every notebook cell only uses names defined by an EARLIER cell.

Why this exists
---------------
Compiling each cell in isolation catches syntax errors but is blind to ordering:
`REPEAT_CSV` was defined in section 5 and read by section 3b, which runs first.
That passed every check in place and failed on Kaggle several minutes into a run,
after the bootstrap, the data load and the restore had already happened.

Notebooks are unusually prone to this because the author reaches for a name that
exists in their kernel from an earlier, differently-ordered execution. A
fresh "Run All" is the only honest test, and this is the cheap static version.

Scope and deliberate limits
---------------------------
Only *module-level* loads are checked. A name used inside a function body is fine
as long as it exists by the time the function is called, which is a runtime
property this cannot see, so descending into function and class bodies would
produce false positives. Comprehensions and lambdas at module level ARE checked,
since they execute immediately.

Cells guarded by `if ON_KAGGLE:` still count: they run on Kaggle, which is the
environment that matters.
