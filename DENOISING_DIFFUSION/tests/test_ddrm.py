"""
DDRM's operator machinery, validated without any trained model.

The sampler itself needs a diffusion prior to test end to end, but everything it depends on
-- the transfer function, the forward operator, and the measured/unmeasured split that IS the
algorithm -- can be checked exactly against known answers. If those are wrong, nothing
downstream means anything, and the failure would be invisible: a wrong operator still produces
plausible-looking images.
