"""
Tests for patch training and overlap-blended tiled inference.

The failure mode that matters is silent: naive tiling produces a plausible image with a
hard discontinuity at every tile join, landing mid-field where the moment maps are
computed. These check the seam is actually gone, not merely that the code runs.
