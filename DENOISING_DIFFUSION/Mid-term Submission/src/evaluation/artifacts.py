===========================
Per-channel artifact diagnostics for a denoised line-emission channel.

Three artifacts have been observed across V7/V9/V12 but only ever documented
from a single channel (channel 100), which the V7/V9 variance lesson says is not
enough to characterise anything:

  * **peak overshoot** -- denoised peak brighter than clean (1.151x at ch 100).
  * **negative floor leak** -- denoised background dips below clean's ~0 floor.
  * **invented structure** ("hallucination") -- the model asserts signal where
    the ground truth has none. Scientifically the worst of the three: in a
    protoplanetary-disk map, invented structure reads as a false detection.

`channel_artifacts` scores one channel so a caller can run it over every
validation channel and report distributions instead of anecdotes. It is
model-agnostic (takes arrays, not a model), so the same numbers can be produced
for the U-Net and the DDPM and compared directly.

    Score overshoot / floor leak / invented structure for one channel.

    normalisation, so clean may exceed 1).

                        background pixels. NaN only when the background is genuinely
                        empty or noiseless.
        overshoot:      (denoised.max() - floor) / (clean.max() - floor); 1.0 is
                        perfect, >1 overshoots the true peak.
        floor_leak:     denoised.min() - clean's floor; negative means the
                        prediction dips below the true background.
        invented_frac:  fraction of background pixels pushed above the assert
                        threshold.
        invented_blobs: count of connected invented regions of >= blob_min_px,
                        i.e. how many distinct fake structures.
        n_background_px: size of the background mask. Report it: an empty or tiny
