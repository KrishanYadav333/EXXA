src/evaluation/recover_version.py
=================================
Recover a Kaggle run's outputs from the commit its GitHub integration pushed.

Several notebook versions completed, wrote their CSVs to the kernel Output tab, and were
never downloaded — the artifacts are gone, but the *executed notebook* was pushed to git
with its outputs still embedded. That commit holds every figure as base64 PNG and the whole
stdout, which is enough to reconstruct most of what the run produced.

Figures are named from the ``savefig`` call in their own cell rather than by output order.
Ordering by position mislabelled three of notebook 05 v17's four figures — it writes
``sweepwinner_loss.png``, not ``unet_line_emission_loss.png``, and writes no
``moment_map_holdout_summary.png`` at all.

CSVs cannot be recovered this way; only what the notebook printed. Where a printed table
carries the same numbers, reconstruct it by hand and name the file ``.RECONSTRUCTED.csv``
so it is never mistaken for the artifact the run actually wrote.

Usage:
    python -m src.evaluation.recover_version <commit> <notebook.ipynb> <dest-dir>
