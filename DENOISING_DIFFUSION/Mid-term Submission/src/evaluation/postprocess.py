=============================
Two cheap, legitimate ways to improve the moment maps without retraining.

Why they work is structural. M0 is an intensity **sum** along the spectral axis and scores
well (~+70%). M1 and M2 are spectral **shape** statistics — a weighted mean and a weighted
width — and they lag badly. The models denoise each channel independently and have no
mechanism enforcing consistency along the spectral axis, which is exactly the axis M1 and M2
are computed over. Anything that restores spectral coherence therefore helps them most.

Measured on a synthetic benchmark (`clean` known, three independent model outputs), against
the control that matters — what a smoother achieves with no model at all:

    dirty + spectral smooth 3.0        M0 60.5%   M1 58.4%   M2 67.7%   <- no model
    3-model ensemble                   M0 80.0%   M1 82.1%   M2 67.0%
    ensemble + spectral smooth 2.0     M0 89.8%   M1 85.8%   M2 89.4%

Read that M2 column carefully. On M0 and M1 the model wins outright, by ~20 points. **On M2
the ensemble alone does not beat a spectrally smoothed dirty cube** — 67.0% against 67.7%.
M2 is a line width and blurring along velocity is close to a direct estimator of it, so the
baseline is strong there for a real reason. Only ensemble+smoothing clears it on all three.

That caveat must travel with any M2 claim: the model's advantage on dispersion is not
established on its own, only in combination. Notebook 07 should carry spectral smoothing as
a classical baseline for exactly this reason.

`spectral_smooth` is a post-process and must be reported as one, with its sigma chosen on
the validation cubes — never on the holdout — via `tune_spectral_sigma`.

    the line width. Choose it with `tune_spectral_sigma`; too large will wash out narrow
    lines and bias M2 upward, which is the failure mode to watch for.
