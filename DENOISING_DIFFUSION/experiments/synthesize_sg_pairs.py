"""
Build trainable (dirty, clean) pairs from the September self-gravitating clean cubes.

Why this exists: the pairs Jason shipped cannot train a denoiser. Their dirty cubes differ
from their clean ones by 0.4-7% RMS where the line-emission training set differs by ~50%, and
one differs by nothing at all -- measured 2026-09-04, see PROGRESS.md. What the batch DOES
give us is five genuinely new self-gravitating disks as clean targets, with stated ground
truth in the `.para` files.

So we apply the corruption ourselves:

    dirty = beam (*) clean + beam (*) white_noise

The beam is the one recovered from the v2 pair's cross-spectrum. Noise is convolved with the
same beam because in a Jy/beam map the noise has been through the instrument too -- Phase 0
established that on 2026-08-20, and a flat white term there was one of the things that made
its early verdicts wrong.

**Honest about what this is.** Convolution plus correlated Gaussian noise is not an
interferometer. There is no uv sampling, no phase error, no deconvolution residual structure.
It is a controlled approximation, and it is exactly the forward model DDRM already assumes,
which is the point: `A` here is known EXACTLY because we applied it, rather than estimated
from a pair at 0.80 held-out correlation. CASA simobserve is the higher-fidelity version of
this step and is the natural follow-up.

Output is named `run_<id>_<step>_rt_<pp>` so `src/data/cube_split.py` discovers it unchanged.
